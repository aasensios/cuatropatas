[< Back to README](/README.md)

This section has the purpose of defining the Non Functional Requirements (NFR) of the project. In other words, the infrastructure we need to build our application.

## NFR01. Hardware
We need a computer for each one, with a decent specifications to develop the application smoothly.

## NFR02. Operating System
We need a Linux-based operating system, such as Ubuntu, with a set of software tools to implement the source code and test the application.

## NFR03. Server
We need a Linux-based server, such as Ubuntu Server, with a set of software tools to deploy the application and perform tests in a real environment.

## NFR04. Software
We need some applications/packeges to write and test code, such as programming language compilers/interpreters, IDE's, web browsers and version control system.
