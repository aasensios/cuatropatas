# Functional Requirements
This document has the purpose of defining the functional requirements of the project; in other words, the User Stories (US) to be implemented during the development phase.

## US01. User roles
As the Product Owner, I want to define the basic user roles for the application, so I can decide which tasks are performed by which role(s). The roles are:
- App Admin (AA), who is able to perform all tasks inside the app.
- Public Worker (PW), who is able to load data into the app through the backend.
- Pet User (PU), who is able to log in the app "from the pet perspective"; it will be the final user of the app, as a citizen.

## US02. Login
As a user, I want to log in the app, so I can use its functionalities, depending on my role.
